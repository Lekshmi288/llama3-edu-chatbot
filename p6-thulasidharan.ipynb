This will use the underlying\n            `PretrainedTokenizerBase.build_inputs_with_special_tokens` function, which defines which tokens are\n            automatically added to the input ids. This is useful if you want to add `bos` or `eos` tokens\n            automatically.\n        padding (`bool`, `str` or [`~utils.PaddingStrategy`], *optional*, defaults to `False`):\n            Activates and controls padding.

The value of this\n            argument defines the number of overlapping tokens.\n        is_split_into_words (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):\n            Whether or not the input is already pre-tokenized (e.g., split into words). If set to `True`, the\n            tokenizer assumes the input is already split into words (for instance, by splitting it on whitespace)\n            which it will tokenize. This is useful for NER or token classification.\n        pad_to_multiple_of (`int`, *optional*):\n            If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value.

If left to the default, will return the token type IDs according to\n            the specific tokenizer's default, defined by the `return_outputs` attribute.\n    \n            [What are token type IDs?](../glossary#token-type-ids)\n        return_attention_mask (`bool`, *optional*):\n            Whether to return the attention mask.

Saute for another minute, until the garlic is fragrant.\n\n3. **Add spices**: Add the curry leaves, turmeric powder, cumin powder, salt, and black pepper to the pan. Saute for 1-2 minutes, until the spices are fragrant.\n\n4. **Add chicken**: Add the chicken pieces to the pan. Saute until they're browned on all sides (about 5-7 minutes).\n\n5. **Add coconut oil and yogurt (if using)**: Add the 2 tablespoons of coconut oil and plain yogurt (if using) to the pan. Stir well to combine.\n\n6. **Simmer the curry**: Reduce the heat to low and simmer the curry for 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened.\n\n7. **Add curry powder (if using)**: If using curry powder, add it to the pan and stir well to combine.\n\n8. **Season to taste**: Taste the curry and adjust the seasoning if needed.\n\n9. **Serve**: Serve the Kerala chicken curry hot with steamed rice, roti, or idlis.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n- You can adjust the amount of spices to your liking.\n- You can add potatoes, carrots, or other vegetables to the curry if you like.\n- You can also add a splash of coconut milk to the curry for extra creaminess.\n\n**Remember, friends**: When it comes to measuring spices, it's essential to use the right unit of measurement. In this recipe, I've used teaspoons and tablespoons. Make sure to use the correct unit when measuring spices.\n\n**Thank you for watching, friends!** Don't forget to subscribe and hit the notification button if you enjoyed this recipe.

We'll discuss its key concepts, architecture, and use cases, including:\n\n1. **Distributed architecture**: We'll explore how Kafka handles data across multiple nodes, including producers, consumers, and brokers.\n2. **Producer-consumer model**: We'll analyze the producer-consumer model, including how data is sent from producers to brokers, and then consumed by consumers.\n3. **Event-driven architecture**: We'll discuss how Kafka enables event-driven architectures, where data is processed and transformed in real-time.\n4. **Key features**: We'll cover key features such as message ordering, partitioning, and message retention.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts, we'll use a real-world example, such as a social media platform, where we'll demonstrate how Kafka is used to process and store large volumes of data.\n\nWhile Kafka is an essential topic in the course, I want to emphasize that it's not the only focus of the course. We'll also cover other topics, such as:\n\n* Data processing and analytics\n* Data warehousing and ETL\n* Data governance and security\n* Big data and cloud computing\n\nSo, if you have any questions or need help with Kafka, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to address them!\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":31},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q2.2 Fine-tune the model on course lecture transcripts with LoRA.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from datasets import Dataset\nfrom peft import LoraConfig\nfrom transformers import TrainingArguments\nfrom trl import SFTTrainer","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-05T05:05:56.661571Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-05T05:05:56.661913Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-05T05:06:00.935764Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-05T05:05:56.661889Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-05T05:06:00.935190Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":32},{"cell_type":"code","source":"mydir = \"./transcripts/transcripts/\"\ntest_ratio = 0.1\n\nfiles = []\nfor i in os.listdir(mydir):\n    print(i)\n    with open(os.path.join(mydir, i), \"r\") as f:\n        files.append(f.read())\n\nprint(f\"Total transcripts found: {len(files)}\")\nsplit_idx = int(len(files) * (test_ratio))\ntest_texts = files[:split_idx]\ntrain_texts = files[split_idx:]\n\nprint(f\"Train samples: {len(train_texts)}\")\nprint(f\"Test samples: {len(test_texts)}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-05T05:06:59.816686Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-05T05:06:59.816997Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-05T05:06:59.825794Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-05T05:06:59.816972Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-05T05:06:59.825053Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"5 en-English-CS639_ Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).txt\n2 en-English-CS639_ Deployment (Linux Shell).txt\n11 en-English-CS639_ SQL Joins.txt\n8 en-English-CS639_ Relational Algebra (RA).txt\n13 en-English-CS639_ Non-relational databases_ MongoDB.txt\n16 en-English-CS639_ MongoDB Operators.txt\n14 en-English-CS639_ MongoDB on Docker.txt\n3 en-English-CS639_ Deployment (Linux Pipelines).txt\n7 en-English-CS639_ SQL on docker.txt\n1 en-English-CS639_ Course intro.txt\n6.2 en-English-SQL 1_ Creating tables (post fire-alarm).txt\n20 en-English-CS639_ Elasticsearch intro.txt\n17 en-English-CS639_ MongoDB Aggregation.txt\n6.1 en-English-CS639_ SQL 1_ Creating tables (part 1).txt\n15 en-English-CS639_ MongoDB API.txt\n12 en-English-CS639_ SQL window functions.txt\n22 en-English-CS639_ Elasticsearch_ Boosting, highlighting, and aggregations.txt\n18 en-English-CS639_ MongoDB Geospatial Operators.txt\n23 en-English-CS639_ Elasticsearch geo queries + Kibana.txt\n4 en-English-CS639_ Docker.txt\n10 en-English-CS639_ SQL subqueries.txt\n9 en-English-CS639_ Basic SQL queries (partial lecture).txt\n21 en-English-CS639_ Elasticsearch API intro.txt\nTotal transcripts found: 23\nTrain samples: 21\nTest samples: 2\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":38},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_dataset = Dataset.from_dict({\"text\": train_texts})\ntest_dataset = Dataset.from_dict({\"text\": test_texts})","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-05T05:07:04.177529Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-05T05:07:04.177866Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-05T05:07:04.200191Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-05T05:07:04.177843Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-05T05:07:04.199464Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":39},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def tokenize_data(data):\n    tokenized = tokenizer(\n        data[\"text\"],\n        truncation=True,\n        padding=\"max_length\",\n        max_length=512,\n    )\n    # Set the labels to be the same as input_ids for causal language modeling\n    tokenized[\"labels\"] = tokenized[\"input_ids\"].copy()\n    return tokenized\n\ntokenized_train = train_dataset.map(tokenize_data, batched=True)\ntokenized_test = test_dataset.map(tokenize_data, batched=True)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-05T05:07:04.499437Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-05T05:07:04.500059Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-05T05:07:05.159389Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-05T05:07:04.500034Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-05T05:07:05.158552Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Map:   0%|          | 0/21 [00:00<?, ?

It's not a replacement for SQL databases, but rather a complementary tool that can be used to analyze and query large amounts of data.\n\nHere are some key differences between Elasticsearch and SQL:\n\n1. **Data Storage**: Elasticsearch stores data in a NoSQL document format, whereas SQL databases store data in a relational table format. This means that Elasticsearch is more suitable for storing and querying large volumes of semi-structured or unstructured data.\n\n2. **Querying**: Elasticsearch is designed for search and analytics, whereas SQL is designed for querying and manipulating data. Elasticsearch uses a query language called Elasticsearch Query Language (EQL) to perform queries on data. SQL, on the other hand, uses SQL query language to perform queries on data.\n\n3. **Data Types**: Elasticsearch supports a wide range of data types, including text, number, and date. SQL databases, on the other hand, are limited to a few data types, such as integer, string, and date.\n\n4. **Data Size**: Elasticsearch is designed to handle large volumes of data, whereas SQL databases are limited to storing a fixed amount of data.\n\n5. **Scalability**: Elasticsearch is designed to scale horizontally, which means that it can handle a large number of users and queries at the same time. SQL databases, on the other hand, are limited to scaling vertically, which means that they can handle a large number of users and queries by increasing the number of database instances.\n\n6. **Query Performance**: Elasticsearch query performance is generally better than SQL query performance, especially for complex queries.\n\n7. **Data Analysis**: Elasticsearch is designed to support advanced data analysis, whereas SQL databases are limited to supporting basic data analysis.\n\n8. **Integration**: Elasticsearch is designed to be integrated with other tools and services, such as machine learning, data mining, and data visualization tools. SQL databases, on the other hand, are typically integrated with other tools and services, such as data warehousing, data mining, and data visualization tools.\n\nIn summary, Elasticsearch is a powerful tool for analyzing and querying large volumes of data, whereas SQL is a more traditional tool for querying and manipulating data.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":50},{"cell_type":"code","source":"my_prompt=\"What are the basic SQL queries?\"\n\nresponse_finetuned=apply_chat_template(system_prompt,my_prompt,max_new_tokens=800)\nprint(response_finetuned)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-05T05:18:37.886743Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-05T05:18:37.887395Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-05T05:19:08.215806Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-05T05:18:37.887373Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-05T05:19:08.215146Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 05 May 2025\n\nYou are an instructor of CS 639 Data Management for Data Science course at UW-Madison, and are currently answering student questions.user\n\nWhat are the basic SQL queries?assistant\n\nAs an instructor for CS 639 Data Management for Data Science course at UW-Madison, I'd like to cover the basic SQL queries. Here are some of the most commonly used queries:\n\n### 1. Selecting Data\n- `SELECT`: Used to select data from the database. It's typically used in combination with `FROM` and `WHERE`.\n- `SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition;`\n\nExample: `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age > 18;`\n\n### 2. Filtering Data\n- `WHERE`: Used to filter data based on a condition.\n- `AND`: Used to combine multiple conditions.\n- `OR`: Used to combine multiple conditions.\n- `NOT`: Used to negate a condition.\n\nExample: `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age > 18 AND country='USA';`\n\n### 3. Sorting and Ranking Data\n- `ORDER BY`: Used to sort data in ascending or descending order.\n- `ASC` or `DESC`: Used to sort data in ascending or descending order.\n- `LIMIT`: Used to limit the number of rows returned.\n\nExample: `SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY age ASC LIMIT 10;`\n\n### 4. Joining Tables\n- `JOIN`: Used to combine data from two or more tables based on a common column.\n- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`: Used to combine data from multiple tables based on a common column.\n\nExample: `SELECT * FROM customers JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id=orders.customer_id;`\n\n### 5. Aggregating Data\n- `GROUP BY`: Used to aggregate data based on a column.\n- `HAVING`: Used to filter data based on a condition.\n\nExample: `SELECT AVG(age) FROM customers GROUP BY age HAVING AVG(age) > 18;`\n\n### 6. Subqueries\n- `IN`: Used to filter data based on a subquery.\n- `EXISTS`: Used to filter data based on a subquery.\n\nExample: `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE customer_id=customers.customer_id);`\n\n### 7. Window Functions\n- `ROW_NUMBER()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `LAG()`, `Lead()`: Used to perform calculations on a window of rows.\n\nExample: `SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY age) FROM customers;`\n\n### 8. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)\n- `CREATE TABLE temp_table AS SELECT * FROM customers;`\n- `SELECT * FROM temp_table;`\n\nExample: `CREATE TABLE temp_table AS SELECT * FROM customers; SELECT * FROM temp_table;`\n\n### 9. Subqueries\n- `IN`, `EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS`, `ANY`, `ALL`: Used to filter data based on a subquery.\n\nExample: `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE customer_id=customers.customer_id);`\n\n### 10. Views\n- `CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT * FROM table_name;`\n- `SELECT * FROM view_name;`\n\nExample: `CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT * FROM customers; SELECT * FROM view_name;`\n\nThese are the basic SQL queries that you should know. As you progress through your course, you'll learn about more advanced queries and how to use them effectively.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":53},{"cell_type":"code","source":"my_prompt=\"What is LoRA?\"\n\nresponse_finetuned=apply_chat_template(system_prompt,my_prompt,max_new_tokens=800)\nprint(response_finetuned)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-05T05:21:28.531322Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-05T05:21:28.531674Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-05T05:21:50.990541Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-05T05:21:28.531652Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-05T05:21:50.989741Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 05 May 2025\n\nYou are an instructor of CS 639 Data Management for Data Science course at UW-Madison, and are currently answering student questions.user\n\nWhat is LoRAassistant\n\nLoRA (Low-Resolution Audio) is a type of audio compression algorithm that is designed to provide a balance between sound quality and file size. It is primarily used for low-resolution audio formats such as WAV, AIFF, and MP3.\n\nLoRA is based on the idea of representing audio data as a combination of smaller, more representative samples. This is done by using a combination of 16-bit samples and 8-bit samples to represent the audio data. The 8-bit samples are used to represent the audio data, while the 16-bit samples are used to represent the audio data in a way that preserves the higher frequency components of the audio.\n\nThe main advantages of LoRA are:\n\n1. Reduced file size: LoRA can significantly reduce the file size of a compressed audio file compared to other formats like WAV.\n2. Improved sound quality: LoRA can preserve the higher frequency components of the audio, which results in a better sound quality compared to other formats.\n3. Simplicity: LoRA is relatively simple to implement and does not require the use of complex algorithms.\n\nHowever, LoRA also has some disadvantages, such as:\n\n1. Loss of audio information: LoRA can lose some audio information, which results in a loss of audio quality.\n2. Limited dynamic range: LoRA can only represent a limited dynamic range of the audio, which results in a loss of audio information.\n3. Limited resolution: LoRA can only represent a limited resolution of the audio, which results in a loss of audio information.\n\nLoRA is widely used in various applications, including:\n\n1. Music streaming services: LoRA is widely used in music streaming services to compress audio files and reduce the file size.\n2. Podcasting: LoRA is used to compress podcast audio files, which reduces the file size and makes it easier to stream.\n3. Audio editing software: LoRA is used in various audio editing software to compress audio files and improve the sound quality.\n\nHowever, LoRA has some limitations, such as:\n\n1. Lossy compression: LoRA is a lossy compression algorithm, which means that it discards some audio information to reduce the file size.\n2. Limited support: LoRA is not widely supported by all audio devices and software, which can make it difficult to use LoRA in certain applications.\n\nOverall, LoRA is a popular choice for compressing low-resolution audio files, but it has some limitations and limitations that need to be considered when using LoRA.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":54},{"cell_type":"code","source":"my_prompt=\"What is the weather today in Madison?\"\n\nresponse_finetuned=apply_chat_template(system_prompt,my_prompt,max_new_tokens=800)\nprint(response_finetuned)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-05T05:23:23.209077Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-05T05:23:23.209678Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-05T05:23:29.725304Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-05T05:23:23.209654Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-05T05:23:29.724672Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"system\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 05 May 2025\n\nYou are an instructor of CS 639 Data Management for Data Science course at UW-Madison, and are currently answering student questions.user\n\nWhat is the weather today in Madison?assistant\n\nI'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to current weather conditions.
