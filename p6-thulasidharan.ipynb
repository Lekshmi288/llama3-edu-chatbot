This will use the underlying\n            `PretrainedTokenizerBase.build_inputs_with_special_tokens` function, which defines which tokens are\n            automatically added to the input ids. This is useful if you want to add `bos` or `eos` tokens\n            automatically.\n        padding (`bool`, `str` or [`~utils.PaddingStrategy`], *optional*, defaults to `False`):\n            Activates and controls padding.

The value of this\n            argument defines the number of overlapping tokens.\n        is_split_into_words (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):\n            Whether or not the input is already pre-tokenized (e.g., split into words). If set to `True`, the\n            tokenizer assumes the input is already split into words (for instance, by splitting it on whitespace)\n            which it will tokenize. This is useful for NER or token classification.\n        pad_to_multiple_of (`int`, *optional*):\n            If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value. Requires `padding` to be activated.\n            This is especially useful to enable the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability\n            `>= 7.5` (Volta).\n        padding_side (`str`, *optional*):\n            The side on which the model should have padding applied. Should be selected between ['right', 'left'].\n            Default value is picked from the class attribute of the same name.\n        return_tensors (`str` or [`~utils.TensorType`], *optional*):\n            If set, will return tensors instead of list of python integers.

Introduction to LLMs: We discuss the basics of LLMs, including their architecture, training objectives, and applications.\n2. LLMs in data science: We explore the use of LLMs in various data science tasks, such as text analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.\n3. Challenges and limitations: We discuss the challenges and limitations of using LLMs in data science, including the need for high-quality training data, the risk of overfitting, and the potential for biased results.\n\nHowever, we do not delve deeply into the technical details of LLMs or their underlying mechanisms. Instead, we focus on the broader context of LLMs in data science and provide guidance on how to use and interpret LLM outputs.\n\nThat being said, if you have specific questions about LLMs or need guidance on how to work with LLMs in your data science projects, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help!\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":32},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Q2.2 Fine-tune the model on course lecture transcripts with LoRA.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from datasets import Dataset\nfrom peft import LoraConfig\nfrom transformers import TrainingArguments\nfrom trl import SFTTrainer","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-03T14:24:41.302386Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-03T14:24:41.303045Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-03T14:24:41.306606Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-03T14:24:41.303019Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-03T14:24:41.305992Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":35},{"cell_type":"code","source":"mydir = \"./transcripts/transcripts/\"\ntest_ratio = 0.1\n\nfiles = []\nfor i in os.listdir(mydir):\n    print(i)\n    with open(os.path.join(mydir, i), \"r\") as f:\n        files.append(f.read())\n\nprint(f\"Total transcripts found: {len(files)}\")\nsplit_idx = int(len(files) * (test_ratio))\ntest_texts = files[:split_idx]\ntrain_texts = files[split_idx:]\n\nprint(f\"Train samples: {len(train_texts)}\")\nprint(f\"Test samples: {len(test_texts)}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-03T14:44:20.299023Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-03T14:44:20.299354Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-03T14:44:20.306766Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-03T14:44:20.299333Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-03T14:44:20.306134Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"4 en-English-CS639_ Docker.txt\n16 en-English-CS639_ MongoDB Operators.txt\n5 en-English-CS639_ Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).txt\n13 en-English-CS639_ Non-relational databases_ MongoDB.txt\n6.1 en-English-CS639_ SQL 1_ Creating tables (part 1).txt\n9 en-English-CS639_ Basic SQL queries (partial lecture).txt\n11 en-English-CS639_ SQL Joins.txt\n15 en-English-CS639_ MongoDB API.txt\n22 en-English-CS639_ Elasticsearch_ Boosting, highlighting, and aggregations.txt\n7 en-English-CS639_ SQL on docker.txt\n17 en-English-CS639_ MongoDB Aggregation.txt\n18 en-English-CS639_ MongoDB Geospatial Operators.txt\n21 en-English-CS639_ Elasticsearch API intro.txt\n1 en-English-CS639_ Course intro.txt\n6.2 en-English-SQL 1_ Creating tables (post fire-alarm).txt\n12 en-English-CS639_ SQL window functions.txt\n23 en-English-CS639_ Elasticsearch geo queries + Kibana.txt\n3 en-English-CS639_ Deployment (Linux Pipelines).txt\n10 en-English-CS639_ SQL subqueries.txt\n2 en-English-CS639_ Deployment (Linux Shell).txt\n14 en-English-CS639_ MongoDB on Docker.txt\n8 en-English-CS639_ Relational Algebra (RA).txt\n20 en-English-CS639_ Elasticsearch intro.txt\nTotal transcripts found: 23\nTrain samples: 21\nTest samples: 2\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":43},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_dataset = Dataset.from_dict({\"text\": train_texts})\ntest_dataset = Dataset.from_dict({\"text\": test_texts})","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-03T14:44:23.662990Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-03T14:44:23.663491Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-03T14:44:23.686414Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-03T14:44:23.663469Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-03T14:44:23.685903Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":44},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def tokenize_data(data):\n    tokenized = tokenizer(\n        data[\"text\"],\n        truncation=True,\n        padding=\"max_length\",\n        max_length=512,\n    )\n    # Set the labels to be the same as input_ids for causal language modeling\n    tokenized[\"labels\"] = tokenized[\"input_ids\"].copy()\n    return tokenized\n\ntokenized_train = train_dataset.map(tokenize_data, batched=True)\ntokenized_test = test_dataset.map(tokenize_data, batched=True)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-03T14:51:25.396279Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-03T14:51:25.396892Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-03T14:51:26.083377Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-03T14:51:25.396868Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-03T14:51:26.082639Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Map:   0%|          | 0/21 [00:00<?, ?
